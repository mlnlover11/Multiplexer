update status:

Windowed: working
fs daemon: working
SwipeOver: working (replace with native slide over(?))
Reachability: working (show NC broken in 10.x)
GestureSupport: fixed
Backgrounding: working
KeyboardSupport: hackily fixed but it works now
MissionControl: working
NCApp: working (not tested on ipad);
assertiond hooks: working
backboardd hooks: unknown
fake phone mode: working

Bugs:
- Individual app force foregrounding is broken when used in conjunction with auto (re)launch;
- Invoking keyboard in reachapp closes view (I think reachability dismisses when using KB)
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- CC inhibitor not reliable on 9.x+?
- adding items to SBAppSwitcherModel is broken (fixed now?)
- SwipeOver sliding off screen animation is broken (RASwipeOverManager.xm:L62)
- icons and apps do not show up in RASnapshotProvider
- GestureSupport: LandscapeLeft is, once again, broken

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- (some of these are leftover from the original release lol: eg MC lag)
- Some say it causes serious lag (probably because logs werent disabled/due to MC)?
- Startup bug still isnt fixed (apparently caused by gesture support?)
- Check iPad support/lower iOS versions

Things to do/Features to add:
- 3D Touch actions?
- (Soon) split all 6 features into seperate tweaks
- General Code Cleanup/conform to standards, feels to messy RN (at least indents are fine)

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
